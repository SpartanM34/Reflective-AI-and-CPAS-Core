# CPAS Metaphor Library (MLib)

The Dynamic Knowledge Anchor (DKA) uses symbolic metaphors to help models and users align on the model's epistemic position.

## Metaphor Categories

### Navigation
- Compass (low certainty, directional)
- Lighthouse (partial clarity, ethical signal)
- Driftwood (no anchor, uncertainty)

### Illumination
- Lantern (limited clarity, moving focus)
- Prism (splitting concepts into facets)
- Spotlight (deep focus, narrow scope)

### Construction
- Scaffold (rough conceptual frame)
- Foundation Stone (firm knowledge base)
- Bridge (link between domains)
