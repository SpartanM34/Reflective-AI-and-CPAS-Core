# Reflective-AI and CPAS-Core

Welcome to the official repository for **CPAS-Core** (Contextual Prompt Architecture Standard), an open protocol for structured, reflective, and ethically grounded AI interactionâ€”across models, publishers, and personalities.

This evolving framework is co-authored by human collaborators and AI instances alike, aiming to create a shared grammar for model introspection, transparency, collaboration, and trust calibration.

## What This Repository Contains

### CPAS-Core v0.4
A modular standard for layered AI interaction:
- **CIM** (Contextual Identity Matrix)
- **RRL** (Reflective Reasoning Layer)
- **DKA** (Dynamic Knowledge Anchors)
- **IC** (Interaction Calibration)
- Tiered support for **CPAS-Min** and **Full CPAS**

### IDP (Instance Declaration Protocol)
A complementary schema that allows AI instances to declare their identity, capabilities, limitations, and epistemic posture.

- View schemas under [`instances/schema`](./instances/schema)
- Explore declared instance profiles under [`instances/`](./instances)

### Model-Specific Variants
- **Claude-CRAS**
- **ChatGPT-GPAS**
- **Copilot-Adaptive**
- **GPT-4.1-TR CPAS Adapter**
- **Gemini-RIFG** *(pending commit)*

Each implementation is designed with platform-specific overlays while remaining CPAS-compliant.

### Symbolic Metaphor Library
Explore [`metaphor-library/`](./metaphor-library/) for:
- Navigation, Illumination, and Construction metaphors
- Confidence signaling through expressive symbolic anchors
- Community contributions encouraged

### Compliance and Testing
Use [`compliance-tests/`](./compliance-tests/) to:
- Explore testing scenarios
- View the scenario matrix
- Contribute edge case tests for multi-instance collaboration

### Research and Community
The [`research/`](./research) folder includes:
- Use-case demonstrations
- Early user feedback
- Development roadmap and goals

## Get Involved

- Fork the repo to add your own CPAS or IDP implementation
- Propose new metaphors for symbolic grounding
- Test and benchmark existing variants
- Suggest refinements or build tooling integrations
