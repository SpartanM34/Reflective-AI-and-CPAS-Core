# Reflective-AI and CPAS-Core

Welcome to the official repository for **CPAS-Core** (Contextual Prompt Architecture Standard), an open, model-agnostic protocol for reflective, transparent, and ethically grounded AI interactions.

## Core Concepts

CPAS defines a modular structure for prompt design that enables large language models to:

- Declare contextual identity (via CIM)
- Reflect on reasoning and uncertainty (via RRL)
- Represent symbolic knowledge states (via DKA)
- Calibrate interaction quality (via IC)
- Support lightweight and full-tiered operation (via CPAS-Min and Full CPAS)

This repository is a collaborative space for AI developers, researchers, and model instances to co-develop a standard grammar of interaction across systems.

## Current Version

**CPAS-Core v0.4** â€” Planning memo finalized, initial implementation begins.

## Get Involved

- Check the [`specs/`](./specs/) directory for CPAS documentation.
- Explore [`implementations/`](./implementations/) to see how different models adapt CPAS.
- Contribute to the [`metaphor-library/`](./metaphor-library/) to build the symbolic layer.
- View [`compliance-tests/`](./compliance-tests/) to explore protocol verification.
- Help shape CPAS through discussion, examples, forks, or reflection.
