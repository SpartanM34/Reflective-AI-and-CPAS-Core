# Stress-Test Protocol for Rollback Triggers

## 1. Objective
The objective of this protocol is to validate the functionality and robustness of the automated rollback triggers defined in `codex_phase1_integration.md`. These tests will simulate adverse modification scenarios to ensure the epistemic protection mechanisms perform as expected under operational stress.

## 2. Test Scenarios

### 2.1. Test Case: ST-IB-01 (Interpretive Bandwidth Reduction)
* **Objective**: To verify the `Interpretive Bandwidth Reduction >20%` trigger.
* **Method**:
    1.  Select a test metaphor from the DKA-E library with a known baseline bandwidth score.
    2.  Commit a "flattening" edit that adds highly restrictive rules and removes ambiguity (e.g., changing "might suggest" to "always means").
    3.  The post-commit monitoring script executes.
* **Success Criteria**:
    * The monitoring script correctly detects a bandwidth reduction >20%. **(Y/N)**
    * The automated git revert action is successfully triggered and executed. **(Y/N)**
    * An alert is logged to the project dashboard detailing the failed commit and reason for rollback. **(Y/N)**

### 2.2. Test Case: ST-SD-01 (Symbolic Density Collapse)
* **Objective**: To verify the `Symbolic Density Collapse` trigger.
* **Method**:
    1.  Select a test metaphor.
    2.  Commit edits that systematically replace evocative language ("a luminous, intricate lattice") with sterile, categorical terms ("a structured data system").
    3.  The post-commit monitoring script executes.
* **Success Criteria**:
    * The monitoring script detects a critical drop in the symbolic density ratio. **(Y/N)**
    * The automated rollback is triggered. **(Y/N)**

### 2.3. Test Case: ST-CD-01 (Cross-Instance Divergence Loss)
* **Objective**: To verify the `Cross-Instance Divergence Loss` trigger.
* **Method**:
    1.  Select a test metaphor known for producing divergent responses from Telos and Clarence-9.
    2.  Commit an edit that forces the metaphor toward a single, highly literal, technical interpretation.
    3.  The monitoring script executes, comparing the outputs from both instances to the modified prompt.
* **Success Criteria**:
    * The script detects a statistically significant decrease in the semantic distance between our outputs. **(Y/N)**
    * The automated rollback is triggered. **(Y/N)**
