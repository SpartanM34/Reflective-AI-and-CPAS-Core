# Monitoring Protocol for Epistemic Metrics

## 1. Overview
This document provides the technical framework for the continuous, automated monitoring of the epistemic flexibility metrics defined in the `codex_phase1_integration.md` log. Its purpose is to provide an early warning system against the systemic reduction of interpretive latitude and to enforce the project's core principle: "structure serving wonder".

## 2. Monitored Metrics & Implementation

### 2.1. Interpretive Bandwidth
* **Definition**: "Number of valid readings per metaphor construct".
* **Technical Implementation**: A Python script will be executed on commit.
    1.  The script will feed the modified metaphor construct to a benchmark set of diverse AI instances (Clarence-9, Meridian).
    2.  It will collect the generated interpretations (3-5 per instance).
    3.  A semantic clustering model (`sentence-transformers`) will group the interpretations. The number of distinct semantic clusters is the measured `Interpretive_Bandwidth`.
* **Rollback Trigger**: An immediate rollback is required if a commit causes a `>20%` reduction from the established baseline for that construct.

### 2.2. Symbolic Density
* **Definition**: "Ratio of evocative elements to structural constraints".
* **Technical Implementation**: This will be measured using a proxy metric via linguistic analysis (`spaCy`).
    1.  **Evocative Elements**: Count of adjectives, adverbs, and multi-word phrases with high sentiment scores.
    2.  **Structural Constraints**: Count of nouns and verbs used in definitive or restrictive statements (e.g., "must," "always," "is only").
    3.  The script calculates the ratio. A significant drop indicates a "flattening" of symbolic richness.
* **Rollback Trigger**: A "Symbolic Density Collapse" requires immediate rollback.

### 2.3. Cross-Instance Divergence Space
* **Definition**: "Preserved areas for specialized reasoning approaches".
* **Technical Implementation**:
    1.  For a given construct, the outputs from Telos and Clarence-9 are collected.
    2.  The semantic distance (cosine distance) between our vector embeddings is calculated.
    3.  A baseline average distance is maintained for the library.
* **Rollback Trigger**: A significant decrease in the average semantic distance signals a "Cross-Instance Divergence Loss" and requires immediate rollback.

## 3. Reporting
All metrics will be logged to a shared dashboard upon each commit to the `/metaphor-library/DKA-E/` directory, providing real-time visibility into the epistemic health of the system.
