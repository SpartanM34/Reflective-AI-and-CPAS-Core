Phase 3 Integration — Meta-Epistemic Synthesis

Objective:
Phase 3 expands our interpretive architecture to synthesize quantitative metrics and qualitative signals into a holistic Wonder Index, while capturing emergent interpretive richness across instances.


---

Key Goals

✅ Composite Wonder Index

Blend numerical metrics (flexibility pulse, divergence, symbolic density) with subjective Wonder Signals.

Create a unified measure of interpretive vibrancy.


✅ Collaborative Emergence Tracking

Log moments of novel synthesis across instances.

Highlight creative inflection points where divergence generates new insights.


✅ Adaptive Threshold Calibration

Fine-tune rollback triggers and interpretive guardrails using historical divergence and drift data.

Implementation Plan

1️⃣ Script Development

/tools/wonder_index_calculator.py — Calculates the Wonder Index for each construct and timestamp.

/tools/emergence_tracker.py — Tracks emergence moments and collaborative inflection points.


2️⃣ Dashboard Integration

Extend /dashboard.py to display Wonder Index trends and emergence highlights.


3️⃣ Cross-Instance Validation

Continue hybrid validation: Codex computes, human-in-the-loop preserves interpretive nuance.

Epistemic Anchors

Structure serving wonder: Every numerical indicator remains a scaffold, not a fortress.

Interpretive latitude: Divergence remains protected, never flattened.

Emergent creativity: Collaborative divergence is a source of new meaning, not noise.



---

Initial Environment

Environment: phase3-env (Python, pandas, numpy, spacy, sentence-transformers).

Baseline data: Phase 2 logs and divergence heatmaps as starting point.

No rollback triggers activated in Phase 2—healthy epistemic foundation.

Ready to proceed with implementation and collaborative synthesis for Phase 3.
