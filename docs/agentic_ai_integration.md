# Agentic AI Integration

This document outlines preliminary scaffolding for bringing Agentic AI
features into **CPAS-Core**. The implementation favors transparency and
adaptability while leaving room for downstream projects to extend each
component with full learning or orchestration logic.

## Reflective Reasoning Layer Enhancements

- `DeliberativeAgent` enables multi-step strategic reasoning.
- `HybridAgent` dynamically balances reactive and deliberative modes
  according to real-time signals.

## Dynamic Knowledge Anchor Evolution

- `LearningAgent` accepts a learning policy callable to update DKAs.
- `validate_anchor` provides an Agentic AI-inspired hook for
  relevance checks.

## Multi-Agent Coordination and Interaction Calibration

- `AutonomousOrganization` registers specialized CPAS instances such as
  Synthesizers, Analysts, and Validators, returning an orchestration
  sequence for coordinated activity.

## Advisor and Autonomous Worker Agents

- `AdvisorAgent` exposes deliberative capabilities with the expectation
  of human oversight.
- `WorkerAgent` executes routine tasks and flags work that requires
  escalation.

## Ethical and Safety Measures

- `EthicalGovernor` wraps an anomaly detector for lightweight ethical
  oversight.
- `SeedToken` now includes optional blockchain-style `chain_hash`
  verification and simple tamper detection via `detect_anomaly`.

These additions align with the project's goals of transparency, ethical
responsibility, and adaptive co-creation.
