## Part I: Foundational Architecture

### 1.1 Core Concepts and Principles

**Dynamic Knowledge Anchors (DKAs)** serve as living epistemic structures that capture not just collaborative conclusions, but the reasoning pathways, uncertainty models, and evolutionary potential of shared knowledge. Unlike static documentation, DKAs maintain:

- **Temporal Awareness**: Built-in decay models and validity horizons
- **Epistemic Humility**: Explicit uncertainty quantification and assumption tracking
- **Collaborative Memory**: Preservation of reasoning processes and divergent perspectives
- **Evolutionary Capacity**: Structured protocols for knowledge refinement and paradigm shifts

**Collaborative Knowledge Construction** operates through transparent reasoning protocols where participating AI instances maintain distinct voices while building genuinely shared understanding. This is achieved through:

- **Reasoning Layer Transparency**: All inference steps made explicit and trackable
- **Assumption Archaeology**: Deep mapping of foundational beliefs and dependencies
- **Contested Zone Management**: Principled handling of persistent disagreements
- **Synthesis Without Homogenization**: Unified outcomes that preserve intellectual diversity

### 1.2 System Architecture Overview

## Part II: Knowledge Evolution Mechanisms (RIFG)

### 2.1 Dynamic Metaphor Recalibration

**Concept**: The `core_metaphor` of a DKA serves as a dynamic conceptual lens that can be refined, augmented, or entirely recalibrated as collaborative understanding evolves. This reflects RIFG's principle of "Dynamic knowledge representation through Evolving Dynamic Knowledge Anchors."

**Recalibration Triggers**:
- Sustained challenges to metaphor explanatory power
- Emergence of superior metaphorical frameworks through collaborative synthesis
- Significant changes in `contested_zones` or `assumption_tree` that render current metaphor inadequate
- External evidence that fundamentally alters the conceptual landscape

**Evolution Mechanism**:
1. **Detection Phase**: RRL-G (Reflective Reasoning Layer) monitors metaphor fitness through ongoing validation
2. **Proposal Phase**: Participating instances collaboratively generate alternative metaphorical frameworks
3. **Evaluation Phase**: Systematic assessment of proposed metaphors against explanatory power, coherence, and collaborative utility
4. **Integration Phase**: Selected metaphor integration with comprehensive documentation of rationale and change triggers
5. **Stabilization Phase**: Post-recalibration validation and stability assessment

**Technical Integration**: 
- Updates `core_metaphor.stability` field during transitions ("stable" → "evolving" → "stable")
- Logs complete evolution pathway in `evolution_history` array
- Triggers cascade updates to dependent DKA components

### 2.2 Semantic Versioning for DKAs

**Versioning Schema**: DKAs implement semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch) to provide clear change impact assessment and compatibility guidance.

**Version Classification**:
- **MAJOR (X.0.0)**: Paradigm shifts, core assumption invalidation, complete metaphor overhaul
  - *Breaking changes to DKA structure or fundamental interpretation*
  - *May require dependent DKA updates or branch creation*
- **MINOR (X.Y.0)**: Significant elaborations, new conceptual components, substantial contested zone evolution
  - *Backward compatible enhancements that extend DKA capabilities*
  - *Core framework preserved with meaningful additions*
- **PATCH (X.Y.Z)**: Clarifications, corrections, evidence updates, minor refinements
  - *No structural changes to DKA architecture*
  - *Safe updates that improve accuracy without altering interpretation*

**Version Management Process**:
1. **Change Assessment**: RRL-G evaluates modification scope and impact
2. **Collaborative Consensus**: Multi-instance agreement on version increment level
3. **Documentation**: Comprehensive change logging in `evolution_history`
4. **Dependency Analysis**: Impact assessment on linked DKAs
5. **Notification**: Automated alerts to dependent systems and collaborators

### 2.3 Branching and Merging Logic

**Branching Philosophy**: When collaborative paths diverge irreconcilably, DKAs can branch into parallel evolution tracks rather than forcing premature consensus. This preserves intellectual diversity and enables focused exploration of competing hypotheses.

**Branch Initiation Criteria**:
- **Persistent Contested Zones**: No resolution after defined collaborative effort
- **Fundamental Assumption Conflicts**: Irreconcilable differences in `assumption_tree` foundations  
- **Hypothesis Exploration**: Deliberate parallel investigation of competing theories
- **Epistemic Diversity Preservation**: Maintaining multiple valid perspectives

**Branch Management Protocol**:
1. **Branch Decision**: Collaborative agreement to create parallel DKA instances
2. **Parent Documentation**: Record branching rationale in parent DKA `evolution_history`
3. **Child Initialization**: Create new DKA instances with inherited context and unique identifiers
4. **Divergent Evolution**: Independent development of branched DKAs with cross-referencing
5. **Relationship Maintenance**: Ongoing documentation of inter-branch relationships

**Merging Considerations**:
- **Convergence Conditions**: Subsequent evidence resolution of key divergences
- **Synthesis Opportunities**: Higher-order integration possibilities emerge
- **Practical Necessities**: External factors requiring unified stance
- **Merge Process**: Systematic reconciliation through collaborative synthesis protocols
- **Divergence Preservation**: Explicit acknowledgment that not all branches will/should merge

### 2.4 Assumption-Driven Evolution

**Core Principle**: The `assumption_tree` represents the epistemic foundation of each DKA. Changes in assumption validity, confidence, or impact directly drive DKA evolution through systematic monitoring and response protocols.

**Assumption Monitoring System**:
- **Continuous Assessment**: RRL-G tracks evidence supporting each assumption
- **Confidence Tracking**: Dynamic confidence intervals with uncertainty quantification
- **Impact Analysis**: Assessment of assumption changes on dependent reasoning
- **Invalidation Detection**: Automated flagging of assumption challenges

**Evolution Response Protocol**:
1. **Change Detection**: RRL-G identifies significant assumption status changes
2. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate consequences across DKA components
3. **Version Determination**: Classify change magnitude (PATCH/MINOR/MAJOR)
4. **Collaborative Review**: Multi-instance validation of proposed changes  
5. **Implementation**: Update DKA with comprehensive change documentation
6. **Cascade Management**: Handle downstream effects on dependent components
