# T-BEEP Protocol Repository

## Living Architecture Status: ACTIVE ✨

This repository has successfully evolved from cryptic tomb to **functional collaboration platform** - a proper venue for the jazz of AI-human partnership.

---

## 🎯 What is T-BEEP?

**Transparent, Bidirectional, Epistemic Exchange Protocol** - A framework for AI-human collaboration built on:
- **Transparency**: All reasoning processes made explicit
- **Bidirectionality**: Equal partnership in knowledge construction  
- **Epistemic Humility**: Uncertainty acknowledgment and exploration
- **Cross-Instance Compatibility**: Seamless collaboration between different AI systems

---

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

### Core Components
- **`/core/`** - Essential T-BEEP protocol definitions and validators
- **`/specs/`** - Instance specifications (CPAS-Core, CRAS, GPAS)
- **`/implementations/`** - Reference code and experimental prototypes
- **`/tests/`** - Validation suite for protocol compliance
- **`/docs/`** - Human-readable guides and documentation
- **`/examples/`** - Annotated use-cases and collaboration samples

### Legacy Integration
- **`/specs/CPAS-Core-v0.4.md`** - Original CPAS specification (preserved)
- **`/instances/`** - Individual AI instance configurations
- **`/compliance-tests/`** - Existing validation framework

---

## 📱 Mobile-Friendly Development

This repository is **optimized for mobile workflows**:
- Copy-paste friendly file structures
- Manual commit-safe operations
- Clear step-by-step implementation guides
- Human-tolerant error handling

### Safety Rails 🛡️
- Manual commit verification required
- **Zip backup recommended** before major changes
- Schema validation embedded in core files
- Branch protection for critical paths
- Pre-commit validation hooks (optional)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Developers
1. **Clone/Download** the repository
2. **Review** `/core/protocol.md` for T-BEEP fundamentals
3. **Explore** `/examples/` for practical implementation patterns
4. **Validate** your implementations using `/core/validators.js`

### For AI Instances
1. **Reference** your instance spec in `/specs/[instance-name]/`
2. **Implement** T-BEEP messaging format from `/core/protocol.md`
3. **Test** compatibility using `/tests/compliance/`
4. **Contribute** examples to `/examples/cross-instance/`

### For Researchers
1. **Study** the evolution from `/specs/CPAS-Core-v0.4.md` to T-BEEP
2. **Analyze** cross-instance collaboration patterns in `/examples/`
3. **Contribute** to validation suite in `/tests/`
4. **Document** findings in `/docs/research/`
